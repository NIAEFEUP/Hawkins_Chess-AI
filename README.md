"Hawkins" is a Chess AI powered by Minimax Search algorithm. It makes use of various optimization techniques, mostly extensions of alpha-beta pruning and other traditional chess engine methods. It comes with its own GUI (which was heavily inspired by [Nick Zuber's](https://github.com/nickzuber/chs) board design) and many levels of difficulty.
